#### Primary goal

**Allow users to easily and securely connect to eduroam**


#### Subgoals

The geteduroam project has two subgoals

1. Create apps to allow users to easily set up eduroam correctly on their devices
2. Develop server software to issue client certificates that the apps can use


#### Rationale

In the EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS protocols, the users password is sent over the air encrypted for every login, but **the server certificates used for the secure channel are not always validated**.  There are multiple known attacks that exploit this.

We believe that users get the best security by using EAP-TLS. This is why **we develop server software that can issue client certificates** to be used with EAP-TLS.

Not every institution or roaming operator will use our infrastructure for EAP-TLS from day one.  Because of this, **the geteduroam app will also support EAP-PEAP and EAP-TTLS**, so that users can still have the highest possible level of protection available when they use the geteduroam app.
